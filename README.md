## Methods

### Self-supervision
Leverages auxiliary tasks (e.g., rotation prediction, contrastive learning) to adapt models during test time.

- [Paper Title](#) - Author(s), Conference, Year

### Information Entropy
Minimizes prediction entropy or maximizes mutual information to increase confidence on test inputs.

- [Paper Title](#)

### Batch Normalization
Adapts batch norm statistics or fine-tunes BN layers on test data.

- [Paper Title](#)

### Pseudo Labeling
Uses confident test predictions as pseudo-labels for further optimization.

- [Paper Title](#)

### Class Prototype
Aligns test features with precomputed class-wise centroids from the source domain.

- [Paper Title](#)

### Feature Alignment
Matches source and target feature distributions using domain alignment strategies.

- [Paper Title](#)

### Generative Modeling
Utilizes generative models to synthesize source-like data or features for adaptation.

- [Paper Title](#)

### Nearest Neighbors
Applies feature-space similarity and nearest neighbor reasoning to guide test-time adaptation.

- [Paper Title](#)

### Augmentation Invariance
Enforces consistency between model predictions for different augmented views of the same test input.

- [Paper Title](#)

### Meta-learning
Trains the model to quickly adapt to test-time distributions using meta-learning principles.

- [Paper Title](#)

### Time-varying TTA
Focuses on non-stationary test-time settings and adapts models over time as data distributions evolve.

- [Paper Title](#)

## TTA Settings

### Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA)
Assumes the source data is not available during adaptation; only a pretrained model is used.

- [Paper Title](#)

### Test-Time Batch Adaptation (TTBA)
Adapts the model using batches of test samples; may rely on batch-level statistics or inter-sample consistency.

- [Paper Title](#)

### Test-Time Instance Adaptation (TTIA)
Each test sample is adapted independently without assuming access to other test samples.

- [Paper Title](#)

### Online Test-Time Adaptation (OTTA)
Continuously adapts the model on a stream of incoming test samples.

- [Paper Title](#)

### Test-Time Prior Adaptation (TTPA)
Incorporates prior knowledge such as label distributions, class priors, or structural constraints at test time.
