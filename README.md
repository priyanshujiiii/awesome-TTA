---

### Batch Normalization
Updates BatchNorm statistics or affine parameters using test data for adaptation.

### Class Prototype
Aligns test-time feature vectors with source-class centroids for improved classification.

- [Paper Title](#)

---

### Feature Alignment
Matches the feature distribution of test data to that of the source using domain adaptation techniques.

- [Paper Title](#)

---

### Generative Modeling
Uses models like GANs, VAEs, or diffusion models to enhance or translate test data into source-like representations.

- [Paper Title](#)

---

### Nearest Neighbors
Uses similarity in feature space for nearest-neighbor classification or consistency enforcement.
